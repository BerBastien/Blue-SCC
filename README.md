# BlueSCC
Calculating the Blue Social Cost of Carbon
The current repository runs on R (R-4.4.2) to calculate biophysical and eocnomic damage functions of corals, mangroves, fisheries, mariculture and seaports. To run these files go to the folder code and to the subfolders of each tyoe of capital.

The python (Python 3.14) files in the folder code/SCC/ convert those damage functions to files ready to plug into RICE50+

The user needs RICE50+ to calculate the Blue SCC: https://github.com/witch-team/RICE50xmodel

Once the user gets the results the figures are replicable running the code code/MainText_Figures_Code

Typical running time in a normal computer takes less than one hour
